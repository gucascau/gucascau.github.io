I am currently serving as the Senior Bioinformatic Scientist and Bioinformatic Director at the Kidney and Urinary Tract Center, Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus. I earned my Ph.D. from King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia and subsequently conducted my postdoctoral fellowship at prestigious institutions such as Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Houston Methodist Hospital, and Weill Cornell Medical College. 

My expertise lies in bioinformatics software and pipeline development, large-scale data system analysis, and manuscript and grant writing. I possess extensive experience in analyzing genomic, epigenetic, transcriptomic, and proteomic sequences across various platforms. Currently, I play a pivotal role in advancing projects related to pyelonephritis, diabetic nephropathy, acute kidney injury, bladder dysfunction, and urinary tract infections. My professional journey has equipped me with a profound understanding of diverse analyses, contributing significantly to the progress of our research endeavors
