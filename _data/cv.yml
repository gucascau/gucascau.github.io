      institution: King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)
      year: 01/15 -- 10/18 
      description:
        - Created two automatic pipelines to assemble 8 whole genomes and annotate them.
        - Investigated the evolution of coral calcification and thermal resilience specification in corals, and understood the evolutionary processes that allowed the soft ancestor to become the ecosystem builder they are today.
        - Understood the role of genetics/epigenetics in response to stress, and explore new strategies to increase the thermal resilience of corals in tropical areas

      year: 11/20- 11/22
      description:
      - Developed DSBins software toolkits to identify and functionally profile large insertion events and other repair products at DNA double stand break.
      - Understood the mechanisms of large insertions at DSB sites in various DNA damage repair gene deficiency, mitochondrion gene defects and aging, illustrating the genomic features, i.e., R-loops, G-quadruplex, Rad52 break site, ARS, TSS.
      - Developed MutaGene to systematically decoded mutation driver of cancer genomic instability to elucidate potential biomarkers for immunotherapy outcomes by integrating loads of cancer resources. 
      - Developed novel pipelines, including detecting nucleosome distribution in forward and reverse strand at DSBs and tracing the nascent RNA changes after irradiation using ERCC normalization.
